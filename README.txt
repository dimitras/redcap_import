Step 1: Split full samples list from collos to multiple files. In collos_exports directory it generates a directory for each subejct, named as the subject. In the subject's directory it generates all the per phase_day files.
ruby fulllist2timepoints.rb all_samples_of_study_from_collos.csv

Step 2: Generate all the files per subject you need to import to redcap. It uses the output of Step1, that is the collos_exports/{subject_name}/ directory. In to_import directory it generates a directory for each subejct, named as the subject. In the subject's directory it generates all the per phase_day files.
ruby to_redcap.rb "30"
